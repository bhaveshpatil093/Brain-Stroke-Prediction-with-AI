# Brain_Stroke_Prediction
This project aims to use machine learning to predict stroke risk, a leading cause of long-term disability and mortality worldwide. The study uses a dataset with patient demographic and health features to explore the predictive capabilities of three algorithms: Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Decision Trees, and Naive Bayes. The primary objectives are to build a predictive model for stroke risk, assess and compare the performance of these algorithms, and deploy the best-performing model in a web-based application for easy access for healthcare professionals and patients. The ANN model demonstrated the highest accuracy, while the Decision Tree model offered interpretability and was effective in cases where independence between features could be reasonably assumed. An interactive web application with a user-friendly interface was developed, allowing users to input individual health data and receive immediate stroke risk predictions. Future developments include expanding the model's predictive capacity with additional features and real-time data integration from wearable health monitoring devices. Ensemble learning approaches could also be investigated to further enhance predictive accuracy.

# Project_Explanition
As this project is based on brain stroke prediction where it uses mainly three ML techniques like ANN,Decision Tree,Naive Bayes.were the result will with based on the data input from the users by showing that did the user has stroke or not.

# Steps_to_be_followed_to_run_the_project
1)Make sure python is installed
2)Install few libraries like 
    *Numpy
    *sciki-learn=1.0.2
    *flask
    *panda
3)Later open cmd from the file path of the folder
4)Run python app.py
5)After few seconds a bunch of commands excuited in it.Search for an url(http://127.0.0.1:5000) and click it for see the result
6)In index page you can see a login button aswell as register button.At first register an name and password later login with help of it.You will find the page for prediction.

# Data_Base
The entered input details and login details can be viewd in database with the help of VS Code for that you need to install sqllite and sqllite viewer from the vs code extension.Later you can see the details from the database code.
